      <div class="row paragraph">I'm a collaborative, detail oriented worker interested in making people's lives, more fulfilling, more engaged, and better through examining the systems that we take part in and that shape us. Through many years working in dance performance, and now moving into tech, I'm interested in how we occupy physical and virtual space and how we can find more ease and simplicity in both.</div>
